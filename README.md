# Makers BnB #

  This is a group project that uses Ruby and Rspec in order to recreate a BnB system.

## High level specification
- Any signed-up user can list a new space.
- Users can list multiple spaces.
- Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
- Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
- Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user - that owns that space.
- Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
- Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
